1. To install PRDMA
  $ cd src
  $ make
 Make sure that the prdma.o file has been created without errors.

2. How to use the PRMDA library
  Just linking prdma.o to your application code.
    e.g.,
	mpifccpx -o app obj1.o obj2.o obj3.o prdma.o
  That's it. You do not need to modify your programs. The PRDMA library takes
  over the persistent communication operations.

3. The following environment variables are used as options in PRDMA.
   1) PRDMA_NOSYNC
      If the PRDMA_NOSYNC variable is set to 1,
      the MPI_Startall operation is started in each process without synchronizing
      other processes.
      This option is useful, if the programmer knows that all processes may start
      the MPI_Startall operation independently because some synchronization,
      such as a reduction operation, has been issued and after that all memory
      areas involved with the persistent communication are ready to send/receive.
   2) PRDMA_RDMASIZE
      If the message size is smaller than the value of PRDMA_RDMASIZE in byte,
      the original persistent communication primitive is used.
      The default value is 13Kbyte.
   3) PRDMA_STATISTIC
      Show the statistics of persistent communications in the error log file.
   4) PRDMA_VERBOSE
      Show which options have been specified in the error log file.
   5) The following environment variables are for debug purposes.
       PRDMA_TRACESIZE
       PRDMA_TRACETYPE
       PRDMA_NOTRUNK
